  - Hi, my name is Roger, thanks for offering to help out
  - "Hi! I am excited to be helping the community, but I don\u2019t think my boat
    can keep up\u2026"
  - 'Oh! you must go see Pete, he works over at the far left side of the water and
    will gladly upgrade your boat '
  - Upgrade? How?
  - Well, every boat has a certain durability and speed level. Your boat is currently
    level 1 durability and speed.
  - 'Will these upgrades make my boat look cooler too?! '
